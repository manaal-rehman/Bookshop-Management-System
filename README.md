# Bookshop-Management-System

In this project we were required to develop a Database Management Software; a Console Application that will present the user with a menu screen with easy to access options to edit a database i.e. Record keeping of books in shop, Selling books from shop, Searching books in the shop and Maintaining the cashbox. The database was to be maintained in a file on the local hard disk. I made this project in C++ via. implementing many important concepts of OOP.
